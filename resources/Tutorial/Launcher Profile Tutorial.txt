Follow these steps to make the custom launcher profile needed:

1. Open the Minecraft launcher and go to the "Installations" tab at the top
2. Click "New installation"
2.5 OPTIONAL: Select an icon from the drop down list by clicking on the default Furnace icon
3. For the NAME, enter TheLV
4. for the VERSION, select "release 1.18.2-forge-40.1.0" from the drop down list
5. For GAME DIRECTORY, copy and paste the following: "C:\Modded Minecraft\TheLV"
6. Click MORE OPTIONS in the bottom right
7. For JAVA EXECUTABLE, copy and paste the following: "C:\Modded Minecraft\Java\JDK17\bin\javaw.exe"
8. For JVM ARGUMENTS, set the -Xmx2G based on the following table and your PC's RAM ammount given by the ModPack installer:

If your PC has ?MB of RAM | Set -Xmx?G
          4GB / 4,000+ MB | -Xmx2G
          8GB / 8,000+ MB | -Xmx4G
        12GB / 12,000+ MB | -Xmx8G
        16GB / 16,000+ MB | -Xmx10G
        24GB / 24,000+ MB | -Xmx14G
        32GB / 32,000+ MB | -Xmx16G

Note: For Minecraft versions 1.13 and below, do not set higher than -Xmx12G
Note: For Minecraft versions 1.14 and higher, do not set higher than -Xmx16G

Setting this value tells Minecraft how much of your system memory it can use,
but allocating too much can actually be harmful as the code is not intended to deal with that much.
